Synchronize issues with git remote.
Note: In recent versions of bd, `sync` is often a no-op as changes are persisted immediately or via git hooks, but it remains the standard command for ensuring work is saved at the end of a session.

Usage:
- Basic sync: `bd sync`

Arguments: {{args}}
Use `run_shell_command` to execute `bd sync {{args}}`.
